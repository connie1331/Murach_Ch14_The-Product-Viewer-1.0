                    Example: The Product Viewer 1.0 program
# Description:

    This is an example from Murach's Python textbook I use for practice. The program Product Viewer 1.0
use objects created from a Product class. This program displays a numbered lis of three product. Then, the user can view
the data for a product by entering its number.

    The Product class is stored in module named objects (objects.py). This code defines a constructor that initializes
the attributes that store the name, price, and discount percent for the object. Then, it defines two methods that get
the discount amount and price for the object.

    The product_viewer (product_viewer.py) contains the main code of the program. . This code imports the Products class
from the objects module. Then, this code defines functions that make up the program
